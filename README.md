# ExchangeBot
			            		* * *
This is a simple bot for residents of Belarus that is needed to get
the current exchange rate and track the progress of trading on the
currency exchange. Many foreigners may not understand such concerns,
but when your salary can shrink by a few percent per day, this is a
good reason to know the situation in the foreign exchange market.
Traditionally, Belarusians trust the US dollar the most.

The bot has only 2 commands:
	- 'help' 	- brief information about the bot
	- 'currency' 	- get a screenshot with the current rate at the current moment.

The bot is implemented on aiograms, the selenium and Pilov libraries
are also used (for image processing).
